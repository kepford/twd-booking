## Getting Started
If you haven't yet, install nvm:
https://github.com/creationix/nvm

### Run the following commands

#### Use the right version of node with:
`nvm use`

_This command will look at your `.nvmrc` file and use the version node.js specified in it. This ensures all developers use the same version of node for consistency._

#### If that version of node isn't installed, install it with:
`nvm install`
